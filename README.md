**ABSTRACT **
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the leading infectious cause of birth defects. Despite the global disease burden, there is no FDA-approved HCMV vaccine. The most efficacious HCMV vaccine candidates to date have used glycoprotein B (gB), a class III viral fusion protein, in its postfusion form. While some viral fusion proteins have been shown to elicit stronger neutralizing responses in their prefusion conformation, HCMV prefusion-like and postfusion gB were recently shown to elicit antibodies with similar fibroblast neutralization titers in mice. We aimed to define and compare the specificity and functionality of plasma IgG elicited by distinct prefusion-like and postfusion gB constructs. Prefusion-like and postfusion gB elicited comparable IgG responses that predominantly mapped to AD-5 antigenic domain known to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, postfusion gB elicited significantly higher plasma IgG binding to cell-associated gB and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis than that of prefusion-like gB. The vaccines elicited comparable neutralization titers of heterologous HCMV strain AD169r in fibroblasts, yet neither elicited neutralizing titers against the vaccine-matched strain Towne in fibroblasts. Our data indicate that gB in this prefusion-like conformation elicits similar specificity and functional humoral immunity to that of postfusion gB, unlike certain class I viral fusion proteins which have been used as vaccine antigens. These findings deepen our understanding of the immune response elicited by class III fusion proteins and may inform further design and testing of conformationally-dependent herpesvirus glycoprotein vaccine candidates.
